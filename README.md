# Phishing_URL_Detection
In the modern digital landscape, cyber threats, especially phishing attacks, have become a major concern for both individuals and organizations. My project focuses on identifying and mitigating phishing URLs to protect sensitive data and digital infrastructure. We explored various cyber threats and the importance of a multi-layered security strategy, combining advanced tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS) and endpoint protection platforms (EPP), along with user education. Our findings highlight the need for real-time monitoring, incident response, regular security audits, and fostering a security-aware culture. Collaboration and continuous training across organizations are key to reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience.
